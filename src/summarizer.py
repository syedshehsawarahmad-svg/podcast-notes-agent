    Analyze transcript and generate highlights, takeaways, summary.
    
    Uses GPT-4o with structured JSON output to extract:
    - Highlights: Key quotes or important moments
    - Takeaways: Main learnings from the content
    - Summary: 2-3 paragraph executive summary
    - Topics: Main topics covered
    - Guest Info: Information about guests (if mentioned)
    
    Args:
        transcript: Full transcript text
        content_type: Type of the source content ("podcast", "youtube", "video")
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with keys:
        - success (bool): Whether analysis was successful
        - highlights (list): List of key quotes/moments
        - takeaways (list): List of key learnings
        - summary (str): Executive summary
        - topics (list): Main topics covered
        - guest_info (str): Guest information
        - content_type (str): Type of analyzed content
        - raw_response (str): Raw JSON from API (for teach mode)
        - system_prompt (str): System prompt used (for teach mode)
        - error (str): Error message if failed

Rules:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown, no backticks, no extra text
2. Each highlight should be a memorable quote or key moment
3. Each takeaway should be actionable and clear
4. Summary should be professional and comprehensive
5. Topics should be descriptive and specific

    This has led to breakthroughs in NLP and computer vision.
